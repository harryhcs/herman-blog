Since starting this blog many years ago, I have owned quite a few Land Rovers. I have recently sold off the white Series 3 109 pick-up that I wrote about in this blog. It’s now going to Australia to a new owner who is hopefully going to get as much joy from it as I have.

But today I mark the start of a new adventure and going forward I will look back on the Landies that I had and the lessons learned and adventures had, but most importantly the adventures to come!.

I present my newest 1984 Series 3 109 Station Wagon (still nameless). She has a 2.25 petrol motor and quite a rich history! Yesterday I got back home with her, I took a bus to Britstown Northern Cape and drove her back the next day, a full 750km. She did not complain a bit and I promised her I will look after her well. I realized she is a lady, this Landy, as I drove her the whole day. And as a lady, she deserves all the pampering and looking after a man can give her! *Happy Landy, happy life.*

The Karoo, one of my favorite biomes of South Africa

Part of the drive was also planning what we will be doing to her. *She has one sole purpose, and that is camping and touring*. So there is, as with the first Landy, a list of todos I have in mind. The drive back gave me a good starting point to gauge what mechanical attention she might need, and honestly, the list is very short. It’s basically sorting out the lights, alternator, and breaks.

She has 57 000 miles on the clock, and I believe this is the true mileage, the engine purs like a kitten and uses no oil. The chassis is galvanized and has no rust, the same goes for the firewall. The body is perfect and the interior too.

Coming down the Vanrhyns Pass

As this will be a Landy *purely for camping* with my family, I will focus on getting her ready for our first short trip that is yet to be planned, but soon to come. When writing this blog the last time, it was only my wife and me, but now there are two little ones traveling with us, and I have to say, they are seasoned travelers already. My daughter is turning 3 next month and my son is turning 5 next month. I hope they will one day have the pleasure of touring with these old classics.

Back home in the Swartland, Western Cape

Next up I will start documenting everything I do to the nameless old lady and hopefully share any insights from the process. And next time she should have a name!
